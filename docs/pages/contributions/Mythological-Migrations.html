    <p>
        Over the last couple of years, we have been collaborating on the
        organization and production of
        <i>Mythological Migrations: Imagining Queer Muslim Utopias</i>, a
        three-year project - conceived and curated by Abdullah and produced by
        Danai - that draws on Islamic mythologies through a Sufi framework.
        Responding to an urgent need to recognize queer Muslim voices as a way
        of challenging rampant Islamophobia in Europe, and more specifically,
        through spaces of exclusion and fetishization, the project investigates
        questions of expanding <i> Islam </i> to include queer perspectives and
        re-thinking <i>queerness</i> in the West to include non-secular
        perspectives. Formally,<i> Mythological Migrations</i> takes the format
        of two visual chapters,<i> Chapter 1: The Nightclub</i> and<i>
            Chapter 2: The Darkroom </i
        >- which entail a combination of artistic and curatorial approaches,
        involving film, performance, live-music, and dialogue. This text
        outlines the current work that we have done, the process of our
        collaboration, and how we intend to move forward in uncertain times and
        politics of silence and complicity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Underpinning our collaboration is a collective interest to think about
        and address: racism,<i> white supremacy </i> and
        <i> invisible whiteness</i>, structural barriers for BIPOC (Black,
        Indigenous, and People of Color) communities in the Nordic region (and
        beyond), and our role as cultural practitioners in challenging these
        obstacles from feminist, queer, and decolonial perspectives. How can our
        specific positionalities of coming from the <i> South</i>, as a
        Pakistani/South Asian and Greek/Southern European, inform the work that
        we do? And, what are the shared, and also, not shared, intersections of
        our experience in a Northern European setting? Many of these questions
        started to take a more concrete form within our collaboration on
        <i> Journey to the CharBagh</i>, shot in Pakistan and Finland in Summer
        2019. This film explored a poetic and experimental narrative, featuring
        a winged mythological creature traveling to heaven, encountering
        terrestrial and celestial beings, ultimately, moving toward a spiritual
        and queer awakening from a Muslim perspective.

        Acting an introduction,<i> Journey to the CharBagh</i> established the
        curatorial framework for<i> Chapter 1: The Nightclub,</i>
        commissioned by Publics as part of the
        <i> Today Is Our Tomorrow </i>festival (2019), immersing the room and
        audience into an aesthetic and poetic experience of different languages
        and historical, religious, and spiritual traditions of queerness,
        metaphorically addressing the migratory struggle. Over two hours at Club
        Kaiku in Helsinki, Meera Band performed a 30-minute set of classical
        Arabic music, covering Fairuz, Dalida, and Warda Al Jazairia. Tamara
        Al-Mashouk premiered her video work <i> Where are you from?</i>, looking
        at the parallels between her body’s history, trauma, and memory as a
        critique of racist and oppressive cultural representation of Arabs in
        mainstream media. And, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto performed his multimedia
        work,<i> Alif is for Awakening</i>, where his alter-ego, Faluda Islam,
        tells the story of a fictitious revolution through the eyes of a zombie,
        who is a former drag queen, turned into a guerrilla fighter
        post-resurrection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Building upon the filmmaking approach, where the collaborators involved
        people in Pakistan, who had already been active in queer practices and
        discourses<i> elsewhere </i> - in particular, complicating the
        perspective that queerness outside of the European / Western spaces is
        only a site of violence and persecution, at the event in Helsinki, the
        artists were able to layer the conversation on the challenges of
        migration further.

        Following<i> Chapter 1: The Nightclub </i>, based on the experience of
        organizing and the feedback from the participants and audience, many
        further questions came up. We started to think about inter-community and
        inter-generational conflicts when organizing, and the creation of
        space/platforms for/within marginalized communities in relation to a
        center that always remains racially,<i> white </i> - and how, with this
        in mind, we can embody better frameworks, methods, and strategies of
        solidarity and allyship. To this end, as we moved toward
        <i> Chapter 2: The Darkroom</i>, reading about projects such as -<i>
            Desh Pardesh
        </i>
        <a href="(www.savac.net/collection/desh-pardesh/)" target="blank_"
            >(www.savac.net/collection/desh-pardesh/)</a
        >
        in Toronto, Canada (2013 - 2017) and the essay,<i>
            Reflections of a Real-Life Feminist Killjoy: Ball-Busters and the
            Recurring Trauma of Intergenerational Queer-Feminist Life</i
        >
        (2019), by Kyla Wazana Tompkins talking about the critical conversation
        that emerged in the<i> Killjoy’s Kastle</i> (2019), a performance and
        immersive installation by artists Allyson Mitchell and Deirdre Logue -
        amongst other resources has proved to be incredibly helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, the initial plan for<i>
            Chapter 2: The Darkroom</i
        >
        was to take the form of a 5-day multidisciplinary exhibit at multiple
        venues in Helsinki. Thematically, the event focused on: erotic spaces
        and practices that are traditionally understood as sexually promiscuous,
        and thus, morally rejected or pushed to the peripheries by the dominant
        heteronormative society, challenging and re-claiming histories of
        orientalism – as understood by Edward Said (1978) – activating and
        disrupting spaces that are otherwise considered dangerous, and opening
        up the possibilities of sex and gender expression from queer Muslim and
        migratory perspective. However, as a result of the pandemic, which led
        to a global pause (of sorts), new working conditions for many, exposure
        of more inequalities and injustices, we decided to postpone and re-plan
        the event virtually for later in 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we live through this pandemic now, amongst other things, the unseen
        potentials and interdependencies of the ecosystem of cultural workers,
        artists, researchers, curators, filmmakers, and audiences have become
        further visible. Moreover, collaborations and conversations that would
        have otherwise not been possible pre-pandemic are now happening in the
        digital realm. While the physical is being missed and there are
        advantages to being together in a space, the need for continuing open
        access to knowledge with our current border regimes, restrictions, and
        climate sustainability is also becoming more possible. Furthermore,
        following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of US police, the<i
            >Black Lives Matter</i
        >
        movement and global solidary protests have exposed that simply not being
        racist is not enough, but how it is imperative to center
        <i> anti-black</i> racism in our work as well as daily existences.
    </p>
    <p>
        From here now, as we think about the future and resuming work on<i>
            Chapter 2: The Darkroom </i
        >, as creative practitioners and organizers, first and foremost, our
        commitment to the invited artists remains the same, however, it is clear
        now that the final output will be physically different - and will, of
        course, require a lot of conversations that reflect on our present
        times. From our homes, institutions, and professional contexts, we seek
        to follow up with our collaborators and communities. When producing and
        publishing content digitally, we prioritize audience engagement and
        interaction in our best capacity and trust in the future tangibility of
        our current intangible endeavors. Creative labor is a process; and the
        cultural sector still has a lot of histories to open up, learn from, and
        overcome. In a moment when precariousness has entered even more aspects
        of our lives, trying to simply translate the world and its structures as
        we knew them to their digital counterparts feels like a missed
        opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clearly, the road ahead is long and requires consistent commitment and
        work. And we seek to live by that.
