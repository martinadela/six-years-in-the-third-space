        The word <i> collaborate </i>comes from Latin roots. Words beginning
        with the prefix <i> col</i>- mean <i> together</i>, implying doing
        something together. The root word<i> laborare</i>, also from Latin,
        gives us many of the English words used to talk about careers and work.
        In fact, the word labor comes from this root word. Putting the two Latin
        parts of this word together, the word literally means<i>
            ‘to work together’</i
        >.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, Collaboration is at the core of any artistic, curatorial,
        choreographic, literary or activist work, fundamentally transforming the
        ways in which we think of each of these fields of work both individually
        as well as collectively. Not even museum thinking, or thinking about
        museums as a form of<i> critical artistic praxis </i> can happen in
        isolation, and perhaps it is important to clarify that I write this not
        as an individual, but as a representative of a collective, a cultural
        center, a para-institution called ‘Museum of Impossible Forms’ (M{if}).
        Formed in 2017 and located in Kontula Helsinki, M{if} was borne out of a
        need for art and cultural spaces for artists and communities located in
        the margins. Now in its fourth year of working, it has metamorphosed
        into an indispensable resource within the multiple artistic, curatorial,
        activist and pedagogical discourses in Helsinki, Finland, and the Nordic
        region; and continues to make its presence felt as a decolonial,
        antiracist and queer-feminist project. As a heterogeneous space of
        unlearning, it has fostered experimental migrant forms of expression,
        norm-critical consciousness, and critical thinking through extensive
        programming towards building multiple vibrant communities within the
        tessellated folds of its space.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this process of learning, unlearning, and re-learning at Museum of
        Impossible Forms has been made possible only by the potential generated
        through ‘multiple modes of working together’ that has allowed the Museum
        of Impossible Forms to in turn find its own socio-political and cultural
        location, these multiple modes of working together is a form of working
        that predates the formation of the space itself. For many of the members
        of the Museum of Impossible Forms, this work is a continuation of their
        own vision and practice, and for the hundreds of collaborators that have
        been a part of the M{if} journey as well as the thousands who have
        passed its doors, Museum of Impossible Forms strives to offer the not a
        platform or to give <i> space</i>, but rather to offer only the
        conditions for collaboration and the ‘encounter of equals’ as well as to
        sustain and strengthen them. But how do we outline these conditions for
        collaboration, for the creation of this cultural forum, where
        individual, sometimes professional, sometimes transgressive acts are
        played out; where people let their ‘real’ selves show – as a space of,
        for, and by the people? And who<i> is</i> ‘the people?
    </p>
    <p>
        For the Museum of Impossible Forms, a relevant and uncompromising
        cultural space translates into the need for an actively updating ‘Safer
        Space Policy’ that can mould itself to operate between and beyond the
        conditions of conflict that surround us daily.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> SAFE{R} SPACE </b>
    </p>
    <p>Why are Safer Spaces required?</p>
    <p>
        Safer Spaces are sites that are senstive to modes and methods of
        individual and institutional discrimination, in their several
        normalised, normative and invisible forms, and seek to create
        environments that are supportive, non-threatening environment that
        encourages open-mindedness, respect, a willingness to learn from others,
        as well as physical and mental safety. They seek to prevent and prohibit
        the outbreak of discrimination.<i> Every space must be a safer space</i
        >, where “establishing guidelines for conditions that are not acceptable
        in a space, and action plan(s) for what one will do if those conditions
        arise, is part of being proactive in creating a safer space. Issues like
        hurtful language and behavior (both within the space itself, and in
        patterns extending beyond activities of the space), violence, touching
        people without their consent, intolerance of someone’s religious beliefs
        or lack thereof, as well as racist, ageist, sexist, heterosexist,
        transphobic, ableist, classist, [casteist,] sizeist, or exhibiting any
        other behavior or language that may perpetuate oppression”<span
            class="note"
            >1</span
        >
        should be addressed with a safer space policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Safer Space can of course mean different things for different
        individuals and organisations; from seeking different forms of safety,
        and seeking safety from different things, safer spaces accordingly may
        change also depending on who constitutes them. Often a Safer space
        policy becomes the only enforceable tool of democratic governance for a
        grassroots organisation, especially ones that attempt to work on the
        basis of inclusion rather than exclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the Museum of Impossible Forms, the idea of being a ‘Safer Space’ is
        an idea that is in continuous evolution, and an important question of
        how our practice may be embedded, extended, and expanded beyond the
        activities of the space itself. It is about naming and thereby socially
        transforming histories of violence by creating spaces of agency,
        resistance, and the struggle for liberation. In this sense, a safer
        space is a form of learning that actively rejects dominant, privileged,
        exclusionary and violent forms of knowledge and acting, which we still
        often understand as education, and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        And so, it begins with asking that if a safer space is a policy that
        seeks to make a space safer, where does that space begin, and where does
        it end: Does the space of M{if} end at its doors, or spill out into the
        corridor, reach out till the front entrance of the building where many
        of our audience, participants and members enjoy an occasional smoke, or
        where they may have informal conversations that extend the program/me
        going on upstairs? Do its bounds extend to the Kontula Mall, its square,
        its parks, the restaurants and cafés we frequent, the Kierrätyskeskus
        (Recycling Center) where we buy most of the cutlery, or Saiturinpörssi,
        the shop downstairs that sells everything we may need for the space
        upstairs, or the various mix of markets that provide food for each of
        our events?
    </p>
    <p>
        The question is not simply to determine jurisdiction but also to
        ascertain where does the <i> quality</i> of influence extend. Of course,
        while it may seem straightforward that the space outside the M{if}
        doors, and the corridors leading upto the space may be easy to oversee,
        or negotiate the semblance of authority when in majority, but is also
        apparent that further distance from the space itself causes a waning of
        the safer space policies’ authority. The credibility of a safer spaces
        policy is inversely proportional to the distance from where a safer
        space policy is issued.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the relevance of Museum of Impossible Forms is to situate itself as
        “facilitating the process of transgressing the boundaries/borders
        between art, politics, practice, theory, the artist and the
        spectator,”<span class="note">2</span> then the tools of facilitating
        this transgressing must extend beyond the boundaries of its own space,
        one that allows a sphere of influence to reach out further, beyond
        Kontula, beyond Helsinki and Finland, beyond the Nordic, beyond… er,<i>
            the beyond</i
        >?
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘It is the trope of our times to locate the question of culture in the
        realm of The ‘<i> Beyond</i>’<span class="note">3</span> –
        <i> ‘at or to the further side of’</i>, further both in time and space,
        past and future, over and under, before and after, arrival and
        departure. Beyond defines the limits, as being<i>
            ‘outside the range of, beyond the power/capacity of, outside the
            limitations of, surpassing’</i
        >, or as a superlative, as in
        <i
            >‘greater than, more than, exceeding, in excess of, above, over and
            above, above and beyond, upwards of’ as well as the unknown.</i
        >
        The ‘beyond’ is neither a new horizon, nor a leaving behind of the
        past<span class="note">4</span>, for Homi Bhabha, the present now does
        not signify the break with the past or a bond with the future, but has a
        synchronic presence, the moment of transit where space and time cross to
        produce complex figures of difference and identity, past and present,
        inside and outside, inclusion and exclusion. For there is a sense of
        disorientation, a disturbance of direction, in the ‘beyond’: an
        exploratory, restless movement caught so well in the French rendition of
        the words<i> au-delà </i> – here and there, on all sides, fort/da,
        hither and thither, back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‘Beyond’ signifies spatial distance, marks progress, promises the
        future; but our intimations of exceeding the barrier or boundary – the
        very act of going beyond – are unknowable, unrepresentable, without a
        return to the ‘present’. Being in the ‘beyond’, then, is to inhabit an
        intervening space. In the spirit of inhabiting the intervening spaces, a
        space between pre- and post- COVID-19, a of physical distancing and
        social solidarity, a space of finding new methods of collaboration, I
        propose that we re-configure the ways in which we understand space
        itself.

        <b>SAFE{R} PEOPLE</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the context of socio-political thought, if the walls of the house are
        the first and the basic unit or cell of society, it is also its most
        fundamental division – the house protects and gives security and
        privacy, from others. This means that it is a contingent grouping – by
        creating the grouping of a ‘family’, one is also automatically creating
        another group, ‘non-family’. Moving from this agrarian construct of the
        wall, further divisions and groupings may be extrapolated, into the
        compound wall, the locality, the suburb, city, district, state, nation,
        continent, planet, solar system, galaxy, the known universe... one’s
        choice, if it were possible to make such a choice, would ideally be
        dependent on one’s own comfort with the level of contingency. At which
        stage do we choose to exclude, to perform the inevitable act of
        exclusion? At which stage do we define ‘We, the People’? An almost
        Kafkaesque transmogrification connects the prehistoric past to sci-fi
        future. “Who really are ‘the people’? And what operation of discursive
        power circumscribes ‘the people’ at any given moment, and for what
        purpose?”<span class="note">5</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        What distinguishes the political from a civil society is that “the
        discourse of citizen’s rights must translate into a preemptive
        commitment to radical change”.<span class="note">6</span> This change
        is in the stark light of a reality where the rifts between power
        structures and the subjugated have not decreased; neither have the gaps
        between class distinctions. Rather, we are in a contemporary world that
        today has created new levels of precarity – the useless class, the
        refugee class, and in contrast a new kind of human being – “the kind
        that are put in concentration camps by their foes and in internment
        camps by their friends”<span class="note">7</span>. Today, where we do
        not wall others in, we wall them out. The state of fellow-imprisonment
        is paramount.
    </p>
    <p>
        How does collaboration work in these circumstances, and what do words
        such as solidarity mean – How do acts and expressions of individuality
        curb our synchronisation with others? And Why?
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the fundamental question of Classical Social Theory, as it
        developed in Europe, started out from the experience of alienation, and
        its development accompanied successive transpositions of alienation to
        higher levels of mediation shaping cultural, social, political,
        economic, legal and educational processes and institutions. The concept
        of alienation is deeply embedded in all the major religions as well as
        the social and political theories of the civilised epoch, the idea that
        some time in the past people lived in harmony, and then there was some
        kind of rupture which left people feeling like foreigners in the world,
        that sometime in the future this alienation would be overcome and
        humanity would again live in harmony with itself and Nature. But this
        utopian desire of consensus<span class="note">8</span> is at odds with
        the world we have cultivated, one that leaves us all experiencing the<i>
            Perpetual Foreigner Syndrome</i
        ><span class="note">9</span> . It is imperative for us to go beyond it
        now, through the mode of sympathetic critique. We now need new
        cartography based on the mapping of continents of affinities, and a
        search for commonalities based on jointly faced crises and shared
        predicaments; to move beyond static Safer Spaces, to becoming ‘Safer
        People’.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whatever Museums may not do, it must do this – It must be unflinchingly
        cognizant of our differences, our diversity, our plurality; but it must
        also highlight our affinities, our intersections, our togetherness – in
        order to counter alienation by providing spaces for familiarisation.
        Familiarisation is the key function for the Museum of today, the act of
        familiarising ourselves to each other is the crucial task we face.
        Through it we present ourselves “[…] only as members of a biological
        species which has a remarkable history, and whose disappearance none of
        us can desire”<span class="note">10</span>, rather than as beings who
        present themselves to each other as unrecognisable aliens, self censored
        and segregated into claims of uniqueness and markers of identity that
        can have no ultimate meaning.
