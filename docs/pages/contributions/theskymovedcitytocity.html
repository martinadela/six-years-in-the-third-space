        The morning of the day<br />
        when we first sat at home, those<br />
        who had a home and could sit inside <br />
        saw from their windows fluffy clouds against<br />
        a blue Puotila<span class="note">1</span> sky and marvelled at how
        it<br />
        showed them off, out and about<br />
        as humans finally remained quiet, locked down<br />
        How it contrasted with the scene from<br />
        a few months ago, of fire and smoke<br />
        inside Ulwe<span class="note">2</span> mangroves <br />
    </p>
    <p class="poemparagraph">
        The fires burned huge, and the smell<br />
        of burning and butchering was foul<br />
        These skies, fires, and forests we share<br />
        are not kept alive by noble speeches<br />
        They have learnt to remain invisible<br />
        to land grabbing and border building<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poemparagraph">
        The skyâ€™s mouth went dry<br />
        it could not speak<br />
        it got a sore throat<br />
        it longed for water to drink<br />
    </p>
    <p class="poemparagraph">
        The sky moved city to city<br />
        speaking of the burning land<br />

        The current crisis of coronavirus has made us all home-bound. Suddenly
        the home has gained a kind of prominence in a professional set-up. With
        artists taking over gallery Instagram handles, showing how they work
        from home and even conducting online workshops, they are making the home
        public. This public space of the home when it was private was defined as
        being domestic. Several artists, especially women who chose to work at
        home due to caregiving obligations have been seldom accredited in the
        same manner as an artist who works from a studio. My search for this
        singular beauty of art-making in the chaos of a home that expands and
        envelopes everything that it rubs against is a call to fellow
        practitioners who practice similarly. It is a call to acknowledge time,
        discomfort, cultural reality and sometimes even the struggle to have a
        working table in the living room. Artmaking is a seamless and ceaseless
        process that pushes forward the political act of everyday resistance to
        social norms, patriarchy, dominant socio-political narrative, and
        identity. I find myself drawn increasingly towards mending, stitching,
        collecting, appropriating, making and I draw many parallels to my
        mental-makeup when I am attending to household chores such as washing
        dishes, doing laundry, cooking, and cleaning. Earlier I drew these
        parallels as a coping mechanism because the dominant narrative, however
        invisible, is, that a home-bound domestic practice is not a professional
        art practice. But very soon I realised how profoundly the smallest
        gestures of looking, reacting, problem-solving, foraging, making-do
        conversed with my thinking reading mind. These boundaries started
        getting mixed.

        We are living in trying times. We have to start making art today. What
        we make today will become part of history because we cannot expect the
        state to be a keeper of our memory, we cannot expect media to be a
        keeper of our memory, we cannot even trust our own memory, hence we must
        write everything down. When things are changing so fast, we are
        experiencing them at a deep level. One thinks I will remember this
        forever. As time passes, one memory overlays another and hence it is
        important to produce a record for ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I am making a work, I am processing experience through a
        visual-verbal language so that what I am experiencing becomes more real
        and meaningful. And what is life except the desire to make life, our
        striving more meaningful?
    </p>

        We do not know what is happening in the world right now. The most
        authoritative truth is being produced by the so-called experts and
        populists who are telling us lies. So, as art practitioners, we have to
        resort to our dumbness in order to produce the most honest work we can
        and record this anxiety with a certain degree of clarity.
    </p>

        Can we take forward this confrontation and curiosity to think more about
        a home-bound practice as a vital form of contemporary expression - like
        making a different use of the kitchen timer. Seeking some kind of truth
        by making something and then waiting patiently till it becomes art. How
        often does the daily struggle to attend to a chore become art, has to be
        tried again and again. To be filled with doubt is art and it is directly
        linked to making art at home because working from home blurs the line
        between the domestic and the academic. You see the unfamiliar in a light
        that is familiar. The most exciting art-making is where there is a
        blurring of genres where that which is fossilised as a convention
        loosens and something new is seen.
