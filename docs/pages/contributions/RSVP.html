    RSVP - Letters and Dates between Spaces' is a durational project between Third Space collective and four members of the Querq community: 
    The project began in the Spring 2020 and it is based on collaboration in the form of exchange of “letters”, small tasks/exercises, and 
    after the Covid19 lockdown, also co-hosted gatherings.Iida Nissinen, Laura Rämö, Tuisku Lehto, and Oona Heinänen.  Pen palling in written letters 
    is here extended into exchange of visual or immaterial objects, scripts for activities, and shared experiences. The first round was initiated by the QUERQ group whose “letter” 
    revolved around the concept of vulnerability. Organically then, the exchange started to involve related notions such as care, togetherness, 
    and empathy; tackled also in relation to the idea of working together.

Because it is not possible to share the intimate contents of the existing letters as they are, we decided to organize a workshop in order to 
create something new for the anniversary publication. In October we gathered up over a small indoors picnic in Sepideh’s studio and brought along 
a variety of materials: some previous letters, scissors, paper, markers, crayons, magazines, etc, for crafting. The session resulted in semi-random 
and frolicsome, textual and visual “poems” collaged collectively. These poems are not a reflection of the project as such but rather they are a small 
sample of water picked from the stream of our on-going exchange.
