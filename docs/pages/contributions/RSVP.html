    This project is a collaboration between Third Space Collective and Querq community. It began in the Spring 2020 and it is based in the form of an exchange of “letters”, small tasks/exercises, and co-hosted gatherings
    during the Covid19 lockdown. Pen palling in written letters is here extended into exchange of visual 
    or immaterial objects, scripts for activities, and shared experiences. The first round was initiated by the QUERQ group whose “letter” 
    revolved around the concept of vulnerability. Organically then, the exchange started to involve related notions such as care, togetherness, 
    and empathy; tackled also in relation to the idea of working together.

Because it is not possible to share the intimate contents of the existing letters as they are, we decided to organize a workshop in order to 
create something new for the anniversary publication. In October we gathered up over a small indoors picnic in Sepideh’s studio and brought along 
a variety of materials: some previous letters, scissors, paper, markers, crayons, magazines, etc, for crafting. The session resulted in semi-random 
and frolicsome, textual and visual “poems” collaged collectively. These poems are not a reflection of the project as such but rather they are a small 
sample of water picked from the stream of our on-going exchange.
