      <b> Intro </b> 
    </p>
<p>
    What does it mean to create together and what is collaboration? In my work with artistic production, theory and curating,
    I seek to find modes of making together with others, between different agents in various processes and with multiple outcomes. 
    In my reflections on the essence of the collaborate, I am influenced by the writings of philosopher Gilles Deleuze and 
    psychotherapist, philosopher and activist Felix Guattari, who together were pursuing this very act  – a process which started 
    in 1972 with the book<i> Anti-Oedipus </i> and continued in<i> A Thousand Plateaus </i> published in 1980. I wish to start this essay with a quote 
    coming from the first chapter of<i> Dialogues</i>, a book written by Deleuze with journalist Claire Parnet in 1977, positioned between 
    these two books, which also in itself is a book of exchanges. Deleuze writes about his collaboration with Guattari:
</p>
<p>
    <i>“We do not work together, we work between the two. In these conditions, as soon as there is this type of multiplicity, 
    there is politics, micro politics. (…) We don't work, we negotiate. We were never in the same rhythm, we were always out of 
    step (...). From time to time we have written about the same idea, and have noticed later that we have not grasped it at all 
    in the same way...” </i> </br>
    (Deleuze and Parnet, 1977: 16-17). </p>
<p>
    Deleuze and Guattari started to outline an idea of collective multiple creating that I wish to enter into dialogue with. 
    The act of becoming is here an important part of their conceptual framework, which also previously was used by Deleuze and is 
    strongly influenced by – and in dialogue with –  the thoughts of philosopher Henri Bergson. There is an emphasis on the 
    importance of space and time in the development of the perception and experience of something, here the relation between two
    collaborating entities, which varies in the process, creating dynamics. This is the “out of step” which Deleuze is referring to,
    as something that is part of creating and at the same time a part of facilitating that new concepts grow and become. Collaborative 
    thinking is seen as experimentation, as a worthy risk of giving and taking, a flux between states.  </p>
<p>
    Becoming is thus not regarded as a dualist practice – <i>“there are no longer binary machines” </i> (Deleuze and Parnet, 1977: 2). 
    A binary machine is a dualist machine that puts forward two poles, thinking in opposites so to speak, which need to be dissolved 
    for collaborative progress to happen. We need to move beyond thinking in opposites and move forward to think in assemblages, 
    in relating entities, and organisms. This includes the fusion of the contributing parts of a collective gesture, based on processual thought. </p>
<p>
    <b>Concepts grow from the middle </b> </p>
<p>
    According to Deleuze all creative things grow from the middle, where becoming exists between two parts. Multiplicity is an important concept, 
    which defines a state of intensity:. </p>
<p>
    <i>“A multiplicity has neither subject nor object, only determinations, magnitudes, and dimensions that cannot increase in number without the 
        multiplicity changing in nature” </i> </br>
        (Deleuze and Guattari, 1980: 8-9).
</p>
<p>
    In collaboration there are always different paces and pathways happening simultaneously. These might reach each other at different times, 
    fork out and multiply. One thought leads to a new becoming in the mind of the other and so forth. In terms of writing, what one person writes 
    doesn’t mean the same to the one receiving it. Taking the theory into my own practice, when creating performance instructions this gap between 
    the writer of a score and the performer leaves open a space of interpretation, understanding and language – it sets a direction, but it is the 
    performer that draws the line between the points. It can of course also be the artist who writes the score who performs this themselves, in this 
    case other multiplicities take place. It is interesting how collaboration can dissolve into an organism defined by the shared idea that this 
    grouping is anchored in and the collective movement of the whole. If one part changes, everything does.
</p>
<p>
    The work with performance instructions is related to the platform <i>performance protocols</i>  which revolves around the creation of instruction-based art, 
    which through its distributive channels online and offline gives possibilities for engagement. The project initiates events and invites artists to 
    create and perform their scores with a choice to include the audience, some scores are additionally created from remote artists for others to perform 
    and reperform at the events. This includes open formats for everyone to engage with as well as the invited performers own performance scores. In both 
    a potentiality is present for new becomings to appear, related to other factors dependent on the spatio-temporal conditions of their creation. 
    Especially when it comes to re-performances, repetitions of created scores, then another body is present as well and adds to the collaboration. 
    No-one performs the action in the exact same way and difference is here an important part of the scores recreation.
</p>

   <b>An invitation into the process </b> </p>
<p>
    I have previously invited other artists into my own performative process with the research project<i> Body Interfaces</i>. In 2016 I generated a “processual scripting” 
    in the performance space Grüntaler9 in Berlin. Every second day I had a guest performer who was reorganising and rethinking the archival material from the<i> Body 
    Interfaces </i> project together with me. This process gave an opportunity to reconsider my own method of working and documenting performative actions as well as it 
    was a trust in others to engage with my material in the frame of this project as a process.
</p>
<p>
    An example of a collaborate manifestation from <i> Body Interfaces – A processual Scripting </i> is  the duo performance <i> It’s a Mess </i> created together with artist 
    Aleks Slota, which was a collective agreement on how to organising the space after a few days of performances, making silent consent on what should be removed and what could 
    stay in the space and when the final consensus was made the performance could stop.</br>

   <b> Creating together</b>

</p>
<p>
    In the noise project TMS, two performers (the artist Malte Steiner and myself) respond to each other's sounds. Having only a score and the capability to react on the impulses 
    of the other facilitates an intensive state that generates the expression of each performance. In the process of making improvised sound work, a shared sonic language arises 
    and manifests itself. This is not predictable, but dependent on responses and impulses coming from each performer and the spatial structures of the performance space.

<p>
    Additionally, distributed presence and real-time transmission across spaces can be a way to relate physical interaction in performance art with abstract live coded sounds. 
    One performer uses their body in response to the other performer's use of sound in a dialogue that mixes different content through online communication. The project <i> Deconstructing, 
    Distorting and Queering Dreams</i> is a collaboration between me and the artist Sall Lam Toro, which changes for each location it encounters, rewriting the codes inscribed in each 
    environment it meets.

   <b>Beyond the human </b> 
</p>
<p>
    My research in artistic collaboration is grounded in approaches that also include the non-human. This is in itself a process of becoming, it asks the questions: Where is the border of the 
    individual entity located? And how is it possible to create a shared consciousness, where new approaches to creating can arise? In new materialist thinking the importance of non-human 
    contributions are in focus, which I have approached with them as collaborators. An example is my stone scores and performances with local stones, using these as active agents with a 
    voice of their own.

   <b> Outro </b>
</p>
<p>
    It is important to make artistic concepts grow from the middle and facilitate new ways of navigation and production. Opening up for new potentialities to happen and invite others into the process. 
    It is a wholesome action to create, think, and make art as a multiple entity. This can be a challenge, of course, with trial and error, but one can try the very best to dissolve the subjective for 
    a while and respond to the impulses, thoughts and inputs from another – or others – to become a multiplicity!
