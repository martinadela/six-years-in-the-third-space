    <p>
        For a couple of years my art practice has been focused on performance art and I have been 
        privileged to be invited to perform in different international festivals around the world,  
        where I am often a guest, visitor and customer; but rarely I get to be a host. The international
        performance art scene is marginal and rather small, it has been often said that it is like a  
        small family, gathering around an art form that transcends it’s execution time. As a discipline 
        with not much of a budget, it sustains itself in conviction, mouth to mouth recommendations, 
        networking and a lot of traveling. Performers and organisers will often pay the  costs from 
        their pockets and will charge no entrance fees to the audience.</p>
<p>
    <b> To be a guest  </b>
    </p>
    When invited to perform abroad, I am a guest. I receive other people’s hospitality which in  most 
    cases comes from performance artists that become organisers themselves. Performing at international 
    festivals requires a quick devising process in situ, it is a bold discipline  that asks to travel with 
    loose ideas, which will come together once in relation to the specific  context and unknown locations. </i></p>
<p>
    There are different ways of understanding and doing performance art but for me the basic  things are it’s 
    potential and it’s demand for trust. I think of performance art practice as an  assembly of relations 
    and affections that take place through human scale, audience, things  and places. It has the potential 
    of giving and taking agency as it allows the performance to  develop and be, exceeding representations 
    and therefore linear narratives. As action, it  resists the hegemony of text that so often insists in 
    foretelling it, narrowing it down to an  illustration of an (often good) intention. The performance art I 
    am interested in is raw and  open enough to reveal who and how we are in a present time and space; it is 
    an abstract  art form that unfolds as a way of thinking and generates an experience, transcending the  
    temptation of delivering a straight forward message or discourse. </p>
<p>
    There is a particular pleasure in working with what cannot be nailed down or comprehended straight forward, 
    in what exists in between languages, within the gaps; bodies negotiating with objects, landscapes, audiences, 
    symbols, stories. Closer to poetry than to academic writing, performance art takes place in this obscurity that 
    may ask or even demand for trust, requiring fast thinking, improvisation, instinct, adaptation based mainly on 
    human interactions and relations. For me few things can be more fascinating and real than this, and  when one is 
    a guest and foreign, it is explored through the vulnerability of what is not known.

  <b>  To be a host is an act of kindness </b> </p>
<p>
    A year ago I was in Chicago O’Hare international airport waiting to meet one of my hosts,  an artist that has 
    dedicated 10 years of his life to organise, run and self sponsor DFBR L8R, a platform dedicated exclusively to 
    performance art in the realm of visual art. As I  waited for him I wondered how he'd looked like as we had never 
    seen each other before,  then he wrote me on WhatsApp -<i> I’m wearing a blue shirt!</i>  
</p>
<p>
    Trust. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean willingly to participate in an art performance event. The  organisers offered me a 
    place (which was their own), food, material, support, anything that  would make me feel comfortable, at home. We were to 
    be roommates for two weeks. How  not to feel blessed and privileged? </p>
<p>
  <b>Local Host </b>  </p>
<p>
    Even before we knew this would happen, I felt I was in a moment for changing my working  methods. I appreciated enormously 
    the traveling opportunities and all what they gave me  but there was something disturbing in these flash travels. Scratching 
    the surface from  place to place, the performance encounters were always different but somehow the same. As I  decided to 
    slow down from traveling the entire world stopped too in what seemed a perfect  act of synchronicity. I reached out to 
    Third Space with a proposal that was based on the  performance process but directed towards a local and still approach. 
    It was a formal experiment where interaction between artist/performer, audience and object, was the main issue. </p>
<p>
    Standing on Tarkk'ampujankatu 18, in Helsinki, Third Space started being the local host for many artists from December 2013, 
    with their now classic platform: Sound Room. Similarly to the performance art  scene, Third Space has been run mostly by 
    international artists who have endured all sorts of struggles and have found themselves in need to absorb rent and running 
    costs from their own pockets. Maintaining as a priority a transcultural space, dedicated to art practice, thought and encounters, 
    free of charge for the local community and beyond.  </p>
<p>
    Artists becoming hosts. Hosts and artists working for free. Why do we do what we do?  What keeps us going? Who are we working for? 
    In my eyes, the actual tendency to instrumentalize art and prioritise the hegemony of text over experience and practice, has  
    displaced abstract languages in order to deliver straight forward messages and concepts.  Spaces that welcome and encourage bold 
    and experimental art forms are becoming rare  since they might need to resist local cultural agendas. They self sustain themselves 
    against the stream, but it might be something worth doing, worth fighting for.  </p>
