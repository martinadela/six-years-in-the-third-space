        Let this begin with a plain assumption – that many of the contributions
        here, including the one you now read, have essentially been conceived in
        quarantine or lockdown due to an ongoing pandemic. How evident or
        significant this backdrop is for engaging <i>collaboration</i>,
        especially in hindsight, is up to you to figure, as this text, still
        busy writing itself, knows little of its time- and associates-to-be.
        Then again, by the time you read this, which for you is<i>now</i>, it
        will have to have begun its imminent collaborations with various kinds
        of others; collaborations producing further thought, interpretations,
        knowledge and areas in-between; and in particular, a collaboration
        between insights and contributions that together manifest this
        publication by Third Space.

    <p>
        – That said, where to now? How to navigate this? <br />
        – It doesn’t necessarily have to continue as text, but it most likely
        will.<br />
        – OK. Thankfully there’s now time to contemplate on the notion of<i

        Being still in the process of gathering thoughts for this contribution,
        I conveniently came across a friend’s post on social media that felt to
        be worth a more permanent share:
    </p>
    <p>
        Though it’s currently needed, it’s fairly interesting and paradoxical
        that people are<i>collaborating</i> by staying secluded, by means of<i>
            social distancing</i
        >. Something is telling me that society’s inherent individualism should
        have us well prepared for this. And even if not, it’s an opportune
        moment for a fresh look into the state of affairs so far between
        individuality and collectivity. Means of communication are central –
        already Debord said that the spectacle brings people together in their
        separation. / March 26

        Indeed, there’s much to contemplate. Questions like<i>
            – what constitutes a collaboration? how indeed does collaboration
            relate to individualism; or to authorship; or to hierarchies? Is its
            spread as a method related to new means provided by technology?; or
            to issues generated by changing working conditions, precarity and
            institutionalisation?</i
        >
        – can be asked here, and can also in some articulate or cunning way be
        answered; but not now, and not here. That’s a lot to aimlessly tackle,
        without much focus, in this short form. Still, to an extent, neoliberal
        individualism has definitely been a catalyst for collaboration becoming
        an essential method in cultural practice in general, especially in this
        current century. But is this
        being-in-a-similar-situation-together-and-trying-to-figure-a-way-out,
        where we all seem to currently be, really a form of collaboration?
    </p>
    <p>
        – Maybe. I don’t know.<br />
        – But what about individuals-following-strict-orders-en-masse? Is this a
        form of collaboration?<br />
        – No, I think not, it doesn’t sound like it should be. Please let’s
        stop.<br />
        – One last thing. Did you know that the rise of collaborative artistic
        methods have been connected to the emergence of conceptual art, as well
        as bridging the shift from modernism to postmodernism. Collaboration can
        thus inevitably be seen as passed inherently onto contemporary art; in
        as much as contemporary art is understood as being essentially
        post-conceptual and post-modern in its condition.<br />
        – Fair enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing is quite evident, especially in the context of post-truth
        humanities in particular – that <i> collaboration</i> can be perceived
        as a notion that is as open-ended as for example<i> curation</i>.
        Elaborate meanings and connotations can be ascribed to almost anything,
        and this practice seems to flourish especially well in regards to
        contemporary art and its open relationship to meaning and (the English)
        language. In this perspective, anything that goes beyond any singularity
        can in a way be seen as a form of collaboration, if wanted. This might
        sound a bit disconcerting, and it is, but it needn’t be, if wanted. It
        is of course critically necessary to question, to phrase and to
        understand what one<i> does</i>. Nevertheless, on the other hand, one
        must also consider as to what extent this phrasing and questioning is
        indeed a means to an end; and not the<i>end </i> in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        – Remember, it’s only a collaboration if all sides agree it’s a
        collaboration, and that specific frame of<i> collaboration</i> is
        understood in roughly a similar manner.<br />
        – OK. Sounds like it has to be consensual.
    </p>

        While initially not reflecting too much on my own general practice and
        just proceeding project by project, I am now, in hindsight, more aware
        that most of what I’ve done so far has been based on collaborations in
        various ways – from more elaborate forms of collective practice to just
        plain pragmatic methods of working together; each effort and method
        being somewhat specific to its context and content, and correspondingly
        elaborated. As an example<i> Dead End </i>– a project together with the
        artist Mihkel Ilus in 2016 – was formulated as a collaborative
        exhibition by two authors, mainly to avoid the project being perceived
        as an artist’s solo in the usual working-with-a-curator format. But
        perhaps the oddest and most over-elaborate personal collaboration (where
        all sides did definitely not perceive it in a similar manner) was a
        non-periodical art-project/magazine<i> New Material</i>, published in
        2014, that in addition to its concrete-box-contents also included a
        so-called<i> spatial chapter.</i>
        This was an exhibition-like environment that was phrased as a
        collaborative group exhibition by Kristi Kongi, Dénes Farkas, Mihkel
        Ilus, Kristiina Hansen & Ånond Versto, Kris Lemsalu, Merike Estna, Laura
        Põld, Jass Kaselaan & Edith Karlson and Linda; all quite established
        artists except for Linda, who was an industrial shredder. Due to a
        general shortage of studio and storage spaces as well as other material
        and less-material issues concerning the after-life of artworks, the
        artists agreed to give their excess works to be shredded in
        collaboration with Linda, and mixed together in order to form a sort of
        a new material.

        – In-dividual seems to imply that it is something that can’t be divided
        into parts.<br />
        – OK. That’s enough.
