 <b> Time/space. What is an (artist-run) space. </b>
</p>
<p>
<b> Killu Sukmit: </b>
    One day all factories will become art galleries and then creative cities. There are artists who want 
    to create new spaces, be curators, activists, musicians, writers, workers, drivers, technicians, 
    translators, editors, documentaries, cleaners, parents – consequently, art has hope. When another 
    creative city building is rising, you will think - was once there a factory where the gallery then 
    acted, but now there is a creative city and real estate development. And also beautiful financial 
    support.
 </p>
<p>
    There are very few Renaissance activists in Estonia. After a while, people burn out. We've been looking 
    for people with whom we could work more collectively but in Estonia we didn’t find these people. </p>
<p>
    <b> Killu Sukmit: </b>
    I think we didn’t look for them enough. In the beginning we had more volunteers to help sort out the stuff. 
    But i guess we didn’t know how to really collaborate with them. Is it at all possible in a non commercial 
    platform to establish equal partnership, I wonder...

    </p>
<p>
  <b>  Who gets to access and use the space? 
</b> </p>
<p>
    <b> KS: </b>
    Instead of a classical art gallery, we wanted to make space that uses the form of political-social creative 
    activism. This space, in turn, could be divided into two: an art space and a free shop. Ironically, holding 
    one room made it possible to hold another. Thus, the concept of the free shop allowed us to get a bearable 
    lease with the tenant and therefore carry out an art program. And the support from Cultural Endowment of 
    Estonia for the arts program in turn made it possible to create social space. The audience for our space 
    was both a millionaire and a homeless person.  
</p>
<p>
    <b> MH: </b>
    And those in between. Initially we were hoping to get new / different audiences to the exhibitions and events 
    we organized thanks to the free shop. This turned out more difficult. 
 </p>
<p>
  <b> Community </b>  </p>
<p>
    <b> KS: </b> 
    We both live in a Flower Village district, near to Kraam. But we didn’t know that before we started to work together in 
    the autumn of 2015, when the refugee crisis brought us together. We got to know each other at work. Later we became friends. </p>
<p>
    We started to provide warm clothes for the refugees and left the bags at the Art Museum's security desk, where the contact 
    person collected them. At that time, I was still working in the editorial office of Estonian daily newspaper Eesti Päevaleht. 
    It often happened that after working full time at a newspaper factory, I then went on to work at the Polymer cultural factory, 
    where there was a room full of clothes. The magic of chaos. Few months later, this room became the Kraam artist-run space. 
    From 2008 to 2014, Polymer Art Container Gallery was operating in this room. In the 1970s, this room housed a work canteen 
    for Polymer toy-factory workers.
  </p>
<p>
    With the founding of Kraam in 2015, we also started to organize a feminist cultural festival Ladyfest 2016. For that we started 
    to visit Vao Refugee Center every week to do art workshops. We went there for 6 months. Later we wanted to integrate these people 
    to participate in Kraam’s event, for example “Coffee without Borders” event or “Political dress” group-exhibition. Our initial idea 
    to create a community space for refugees worked only partially.
  </p>
  <P>
    <b> MH: </b>
    It turned out more difficult to invite refugees to our space, than to organize workshops in the remote refugee center. One reason 
    was the fact that as soon as they started living in the capital, their free time diminished, most of them started working full time 
    or even more. The other reason, I guess, was cultural and religious differences. I guess some of our potential audience felt uncomfortable, 
    since we often failed to establish comfortable room temperature and the old factory passageways were not very clean and sometimes smelled of 
    cannabis...
  </P>
    <p>
    <b>Failure </b>  </p>
<p>
    <b> KS: </b> 
    Kraam has always received an operating grant from the Cultural Endowment of Estonia (Cultural Endowment of Estonia is being one of the main, 
    if not the only source of art funding in Estonia): Initially € 5,000 and then € 8,000 per year. So, we have been privileged. But how to cover 
    this amount of rent, utilities, our salaries, how to pay artists? At the last group exhibition in December 2019 - "Soft Narratives", we could 
    pay the artists and the curator a €30 fee. For such amounts it feels embarrassing. Is this the artist-run space we wanted? Or is there a 
    difference if I participate at the Art Museum of Estonia (KUMU) in a big group exhibition, where the exhibition would open for half a year 
    and my fee divided by one day would be 0.3 cents.
</p>
<p>
    <b> MH: </b> 
    Such initiatives usually can’t function for long. We lasted quite long indeed. Sooner or later capitalism swallows you, unless you win a 
    lottery or inheritance. I also felt that running an art space shifts you more into the curator/organizer role and less into the role of 
    an artist. Nevertheless, we managed together to pull off a great exhibition “Pink Smoke Out” in two weeks preparation and Killu had also 
    her solo-exhibition a few months before we shut our doors. We failed in so many things, but all in all we won, we did it. And who knows, 
    maybe we will do it again one day.

</p>
<p>
    <b> How can we invent new, better ways of collaborating, curating, thinking and doing? </b> 
</p>
<p>
    <b> KS: </b> To bring together different people, to see the difference of ways of thinking. </br>
    <b> MH: </b> More compromises and division of tasks, up to a certain limit of course.

    Before one of the “Coffee without Borders'' events, an Estonian art critic wrote to us to pick up all the fraudsters from the city and make 
    them victims and give them coffee! I considered these kinds of reactions part of Kraam's educational program, and I also learned with it.
     We later added to the events that racist, sexist, homophobic or other shameful behavior is not welcome.   
</p>

</p>
<p>
    <b> KS: </b> Sorting clothes, footwear for several hours in a row in the free shop, in an ice cold factory was a political act. Sometimes we 
    had volunteers. But there wasn’t much room for the theory. I read books less and less. And I missed the work with content or (I dare to say) 
    weirdness. Somehow it reminded me of the work of a coal miner. 
</p>
<p>
    <b> MH: </b> And still we were so privileged to be able to run a non-profit art space / free shop. Art is still a privilege that in a world 
    context few can afford. I recently re-read  Irving Stone's “Lust for life”, where he wrote how Van Gogh tried to help coal miners in Borinage 
    and almost died doing it, since he wasn't able to endure such conditions.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Encounter / dis-encounter </b> </br>
    <b> KS: </b> The most surprising encounter was that the free shop in Kraam was broken into three times. Which is a kind of paranoia in society. 
    A hope that poverty can enrich.
</p>
<p>
    <b> MH: </b> 
    During the two free shop tours around Estonian small villages, we encountered several active free shops, which was a positive surprise. 
    Yet we also saw that the real need was outside the capital. Though these two week long tours were exhausting, I am so glad we undertook this 
    mission, which was full of encounters and dis-encounters - full of life.

<b>The past, the present and the future

<b> KS: </b>
At this very moment, I write this text during my 13th day of quarantine. I'm working on my “Queen Lear” embroidery creation. As one of my friends said - 
for most of the people this is a crisis, but for most of the artists this is everyday practice. If you think that artists do not have a pay day or a 
health insurance fund. All they ever had was an indefinite crisis. We ain't got no money, honey, but we got crisis.

</p>
<p>
    <b> MH: </b> 
    During the last three years, besides co-running Kraam and doing some documentary films I gave birth to two sons, who need more and more of my attention. 
    One just started crying…
