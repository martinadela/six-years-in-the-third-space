    Preface - a personal experience: in 2005 I moved from Andalusia Spain to Helsinki Finland. My
motivation to do so was two-fold: on the one hand I felt the strong desire to connect to my
Finnish roots (I'm the son of a Finnish mother and a German father), and on the other hand I
passed the entrance exam to the music technology study program at Sibelius Academy´s Centre
for Music & Technology. So it seemed like a win-win situation at the time and I went for it.
Shortly after my arrival in Finland, I started to get in touch with Helsinki's arts scene and local
artists and found out, to my great surprise and horror, that artists in Finland have to pay in order
to exhibit their work in galleries. What???!!! Yup, you heard me right: pay to exhibit is the motto
here in Finland! Never in all my life have I heard of anything as absurd as this and I still do not
know any other country where this is common practice. In most countries artists can exhibit their
works for free and in other countries, like for example in Sweden or Norway, they even get paid
for it. And this makes a huge difference indeed!</p>
<p>
Let's have a look at what this unfortunate custom really means and the real life implications it has
for artists and the arts. To create artwork is an incredibly difficult and demanding task.
Contemporary artists are seekers attempting to create the “supernatural element”. To discover, to
perceive, to reveal, to shape, to transform and to make such a supernatural element requires
virtually extra-human powers from artists. First of all they have to put themselves in the proper
mental and emotional state allowing them to fully focus on the creation of their artwork. With
this I refer to a productive state in which they are not distracted, in which their energy can flow
freely without any inhibitions and in which they can concentrate solely on the realization of their
idea. As simple as this might sound, this is already a big challenge, where inner as well as outer
demons persistently appear and have to be constantly quelled. In this context the following quote
by John Cage crosses my mind: <i>“…in order to realize this, all of us (knowing how to say Yes) will
have to learn to say No – No, that is, to anything that may come between us and the realization
of our plan.” </i></p>
<p>
Cage talks about realizing <i> a plan</i>, but we could also refer to that as realizing a <i> flash of
inspiration</i> or simply: <i> an idea </i>. Having interesting ideas however is quite easy, almost everyone
has great ideas from time to time, but going through the often long and tedious process of
capturing an idea and transforming it into the desired form is a totally different beast entirely.
This demands all of the artist's time, energy, love, attention, care, passion, dedication, curiosity,
perseverance, patience, experience, skills and an ongoing thirst for new knowledge. Sounds
challenging already doesn't it? But hey, this is not all of it, it does not end here, no no no. In
addition to all that, the artist also has to find a way to finance the hours he or she spends
developing and making his or her artwork. Days, weeks, months, years, even decades in some
cases... And let us not forget that in addition to that he or she also has to finance his or her
expenses and material costs. Wow, all that together forms quite an impressive package, no? So
between<i> here</i> (the initial idea) and<i> there</i> (the finished artwork) Mount Everest has to be
surmounted. </p>
<p>
So isn't it fantastic that on top of all that artists in Finland also have to pay the galleries in order
to exhibit there? After all they went through to realize their artwork, after all the struggle, THEY
have to scratch up the money to pay the gallery as well. And we are not talking about peanuts
here, some galleries charge thousands of euros for an exhibition. Hallelujah! Superduper!
Practically every artist I know dislikes this custom: “this is terrible, this is unethical, this is
grotesque, this is unfair, this is outrageous, this has to be changed”, I hear my friends and
colleagues complain in anger……...but……...surprise surprise, sooner or later, the same people
seem to swallow their anger, abandon their principles and finally surrender themselves to this
nasty system by paying to exhibit. </p>
<p>
This is very sad and unfortunate, because this problem could be solved so very easily. If artists
would only unite and collectively boycott all Finnish galleries that demand payment, the
situation would definitely change for the better, because one thing is for sure: without artists and
their artwork there would be no exhibitions and no galleries. Period! Imagine all artists in this
country boycotting galleries for let's say a period of 6 months or 1 year. Empty galleries...visitors
staring at bare walls and bleak rooms…this might even be quite inspiring at the beginning...but
then: people starting to question the status quo...and finally: a necessary and unavoidable
paradigm shift. Wow, is it really as simple as that? The straight answer is: yes it is! Yes we can!
So why on earth is this not done or why has this not been done already much earlier? I really
cannot say. It is quite a mystery to me. But one thing is clear: after all the blood, sweat and tears
an artist has put in the creation of his artwork(s), he or she should never become a greenfly
milked by a gallery. </p>
<p>
Now, this is where Third Space comes into play, as it is one possible solution to this problem.
Third Space is an artist-run gallery where artists can exhibit their work for free. Also concerts,
lectures and cultural events are organized there. Third Space as it exists today is possible due to
the time, energy and private money that the members of the Third Space collective invest in this
project. Working together as a collective is of course not always easy: contradicting opinions
have to be united, sensitive egos have to be incorporated, flared tempers have to be calmed,
artistic directions have to be decided, smoldering conflicts have to be solved and different
concepts accommodated. </p>
<p>
Third Space is also a very unbureaucratic venue that is able to make quick and spontaneous
decisions. A feature extremely seldom in today's very formalized and institutionalized Finnish art
scene. This is a big plus especially in the case of the very successful and popular Sound Room
concert series that started in December 2013 and has presented 104 concerts until today. Touring
musicians often ask on short notice, if they can fill the gaps in their tour calendar with an
additional show at the Sound Room, which, depending on Third Space's schedule of course,
often works out nicely. Not to mention all the local musicians and artists that enjoy(ed)
performing at the Sound Room. Sound Room offers the audience a wide and sometimes also<i> wild</i>
range of performances. Its spectrum ranges from noise to analog synthesizer extravaganzas, from
free jazz to live-coding, from cassette tape improvisations to avant garde pop, from electronica to
robotic sound machines, from singing dolls to shamanistic groups performing naked. </p>
<p>
Although Third Space is tiny, with a size of approximately 13 m<span class="note">2</span>, it is truly amazing what impact
this little space and its collective had and still has in Helsinki and Finland.</p>
<p>
So congratulations on Third Space's 6th anniversary! You have sometimes entertained and
puzzled, inspired and disappointed, excited and soothed, delighted and irritated us. Does this
somehow sound familiar? Well, isn't that a beautiful and appropriate metaphor for life? </p>
<p>
I have to confess that I'm very happy that we have Third Space in Helsinki! </p>
<p>
Please keep up the good work! </p>
<p>
With best wishes,</p>
