        <b> Sepideh:</b> So we're gonna start the conversation, what does (the)
        Third Space mean to us. Who wants to start?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Ana: </b>I can start. I wanted to share the thoughts I had in my
        mind after I decided to gather a group of people and do something with
        the space. Before Third Space I had this project with two friends, but
        that somehow never worked out. So, it is funny to say, but Third Space
        was actually born out of a failure. I had the feeling that this cannot
        fail, that I have to do something else. And that’s when I met Rosamaria,
        Chris and Juan. First, with Juan, it came to my mind to organize a night
        of concerts because, at that time, it was difficult to get a space to
        perform from one day to the other, in a spontaneous way. After we had
        this huge success with the first concert, the Sound Room was born. It
        was amazing that after the previous failure we could continue doing
        something meaningful: one could always invite an artist to perform and
        people would gather and have a good time. It gave me a lot of hope and
        that feeling of “WOW, did we just do that?” We were super excited to
        start something new and were just following our intuition, nothing else.
        We all had a clear idea that we can do something together, and so we
        joined forces and started Third Space. Imagine, that's a really cool
        thing to say, we went from failure to success, and that success was
        because of a group of people, not enabled by one person.
    </p>
    <p><b>Sepideh: </b>That's very meaningful, what does it mean to you now?</p>
    <p>
        <b> Ana:</b> At the beginning I wanted to perform and visiblize the
        sound art and experimental music scenes. Later I realized there were a
        lot of people in need of a space, and so we decided to offer it to them.
        That is how this kind of a personal space became a public one. We opened
        it to everybody and that's when the work really started. There was a lot
        of passion involved, a lot of energy and a youthful attempt at creating
        something new and working with people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third Space is a collectively created artwork. It is part of my family
        and I still feel that we can do great things together. It is also like
        home, where I can do something meaningful with friends, with likeminded
        people I care about. Being able to invite people to share their art and
        viewpoint has given me a lot of satisfaction, and also a lot of strength
        to continue making art and fighting for a more inclusive, respectful,
        and honest art scene. Third Space is a “place” where cultures meet and
        form a hybrid that becomes an entity in itself. In this sense I find it
        amazing to allocate culture outside the museums, and to make it
        available to the public free of charge.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Rosamaría:</b> Yes. What did Third Space mean at the beginning and
        what does it mean for me now? At the beginning it was very exciting
        because I met new people: being a foreigner, learning different things
        in a different country, finding people that I feel I can trust and there
        are good vibes... also we were Mexicans ⎼sorry but that for me was very
        important⎼ beyond that, it was a very nice experience to meet
        interesting people. It was very attractive for me at that moment to
        think of us like a gang that could do something together. On the other
        hand, it was a challenge because back then my skills in English were
        very poor. It was at times very frustrating not to be able to share my
        point of view directly with others, and there were misunderstandings
        about what I meant. But then, and still now, I am very thankful for the
        history we have as a collective, it gave me a lot of trust in myself by
        developing my language skills but also by fueling different kinds of
        ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third Space was also fascinating for me as a person who did not come
        from a formal artistic academic background. I was here with a lot of
        passion to do things in connection with art, culture and human rights.
        It was intriguing to notice how sometimes the speech that comes from
        people behind institutions is a bit rigid and based on theories that are
        impossible to fit in certain atmospheres. When I was reading the Third
        Space theory for the first time, I loved it. A theory of a space with
        hybrid identities, a place of possibilities... but then reality
        confronted us. At the end we are human beings with our own imaginaries,
        with our own prejudices, with our own pre-constructions and it was, I
        think, the breaking point for us: the confrontation with the unexpected.
        And precisely these confrontations made us understand that space is more
        than a theory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once somebody referred to the space with the term “motel, motel
        gallery”. I kept thinking I like this term. Perhaps we enabled a place
        that hosts different proposals and that especially accepts people that
        seek to erase the borders that separate us ⎼ although after all these
        years I believe this is not possible. We gave the space to somebody else
        and that person was responsible for returning the space in the same way
        he/she/they received it. It was so intense when we had a very full
        calendar and we only gave away and got back the keys; and yet I am proud
        because we received over 50 projects. We gave space to a lot of artists
        and also the opportunity for spontaneous happenings. We together have
        provided a space for people, and now it is so sad that the space is
        closed because it is so small, and in this coronavirus situation we
        cannot organize live events. Now it is the time to think about our
        future as a collective and also what happens with the space if the
        current restrictions remain. So, who wants to continue?
    </p>
    <p><b> Sepideh: </b> Thank you, do you want to continue Martina?</p>
    <p>
        <b> Martina:</b> When I first joined Third Space I was invited by two
        members that were already part of the collective for a long time. I
        remember I had visited the gallery on several occasions before joining.
        I was really amazed by the content presented through the exhibitions and
        seminars in the space. They made me feel really motivated to join.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was looking for a community to work with: the idea of a collective
        always made sense to me, as in Latin America for many artists it was a
        great way to sustain a shared project. In a way I wanted to be part of
        something, I had just arrived in Finland and I was alone. I really
        wanted to work with people and create something together but I also
        wanted to know the Finnish art scene in depth and be able to understand
        it better.
    </p>
    <p>
        So that was my initial motivation to join, to build a shared project
        with people, It was very exciting. Nevertheless, at that particular
        moment there was a kind of rupture in the collective. I just joined in
        what seemed a breaking point between people and their points of view.
        That period was tough because it felt there was a deep fracture between
        ways of working and ways of being. For me it was challenging to
        integrate in these circumstances. It felt like two roads were opening up
        in front of us, and that I had to somehow choose a side. It was very
        complex to think of working together at that precise moment when a sense
        of unity was lost. During this time, conversations about whose voice is
        being heard, who is talking and who is listening in the collective were
        taking place.
    </p>
    <p>
        There started to be an awareness about the voices that spoke in relation
        to the voices that were silenced, and I think that that stayed with me
        for the whole journey here in the collective. The act of listening
        started to have an essential and urgent role in building back the
        relationships of trust inside the working group. To be active listeners
        furthermore allowed us to also learn from each other and be more
        involved in each other’s practice. Oh, there has been a huge process of
        growth over the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, we actively tried to think together in strategies that
        could make us really engage in collaboration with each other. Care not
        only for the shared projects but also for each one of us and our
        personal situations. It became essential that all hierarchies of labour
        inside the collective would be questioned and brought forward and that
        we could develop a more horizontal structure, where everyone would feel
        safe expressing themselves and sharing their ideas. It was quite
        challenging for a while to arrive at consensus, negotiate, and really
        learn to work as a team.
    </p>
    <p><b>Sepideh:</b> Yes.</p>

    <p>
        <b> Martina: </b> This whole process of learning and growth has been
        really important. I think we have finally arrived at a moment where the
        collective feels like a space for friendship. A space of trust. Beyond
        the work we've been doing all these years and the effort we have all
        made to push the space forward, it feels we all share a feeling of
        fulfillment and excitement about the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, it's been a really intense journey, from this rupture, to building
        this true connectivity between each other. We have worked so hard to
        commit, understand, and to listen to each other. It is beautiful to
        think of our role as listeners, and facilitators. I think this is so
        necessary in society, to have spaces that are open for the community and
        for others to occupy. This is also why it has been essential and
        primordial to keep the space free of charge for artists. We believe that
        with collective effort it is possible to maintain a space afloat without
        asking rent from artists. I have encountered people who run other
        artist-run spaces in Helsinki who have said they wish they could keep
        their space free of charge but they can’t. Well, it is possible and it
        is the fair thing to do. Of course it takes commitment, but for us it
        has never made sense to have a space that would charge others to work or
        exhibit. Artists need to be paid and acknowledged for their work, not
        the other way around. Culture as a network needs to exist through
        generosity between cultural actors.
    </p>
    <p>
        To feel that a shared care exists for Third Space to become what we want
        it to become makes us feel hopeful for the work done. We know that if
        our internal dynamics are fruitful, we can offer better opportunities
        for others that want to use the space. It has been interesting to
        realize the role these four walls have had through the years. A place
        that has hosted action, conversation, reflection, hybrid manifestations
        of culture, and critical thinking. Yes, this aspect of critical thinking
        has always been essential. As the content shapes the space it inhabits,
        Third Space is what it is today because of the projects we have hosted.
        A space that is never neutral but always aware of the content is being
        promoted and its meaning and consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a collective, and as a group of individuals who come together, we
        echo our own cultures, and the places we come from, but we are
        simultaneously immersed in an exercise of building a hybrid culture
        together. In trying to build this shared project our intersubjectivities
        come to play a part in how we see the present and the future of the
        space. It is a great opportunity and also a big challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third Space has been for me, an exercise of collective thinking,
        collective effort and collective intention. It has been a tool for
        change that is at the same time always changing within itself. It has
        changed from what it started and we know it will continue changing in
        the future. So in the end, working in the collective has always involved
        negotiating change and also trying to sustain and push forward certain
        practices that work. I think it is important that cultural spaces are
        inherently flexible and are open to question themselves constantly in
        order to improve and evolve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, I think that's a big virtue. So yeah, I feel grateful for all the
        phases we went through and now seeing how we have evolved together into
        this space for friendship, trust and work that exists today.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Sepideh:</b> Yes, I also recall several occasions in our history that
        it felt there was not much hope due to disagreements, it was incredibly
        hard to go forward. Failures and mistakes are not often publicly shared
        or discussed in the art scene, vulnerabilities and the most stressful
        part of the processes usually remain unspoken. There have been occasions
        in which we all felt vulnerable; particularly when crossing boundaries
        and at some point it went so extreme it created a crack in the surface
        of the collective.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Martina:</b> And for you, Sepideh, how was it when you started, what
        was it that you were hoping for?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Sepideh:</b> It was in 2015 that I joined the collective, I had
        followed the activities of Third Space from a distance. I visited the
        space for the first time in 2013, when Ana had a concert. It was cool
        and the space was so small but so many people were squeezed inside. Then
        in 2015, I had my exhibition at Third Space. I asked Ana how one can
        become part of the collective, she said she can discuss it with the
        others. Apparently nobody disagreed and so I joined the collective. When
        I think about how Third Space was back then, and what it meant to me, it
        was to be part of something meaningful. It was not easy: to be an
        immigrant and not knowing how the art scene functioned and how one could
        exist in it. It really helped me to understand my own capacities in
        curating, collaboration, and advocacy work. Since joining Third Space I
        have been actively engaged in the politics of the art scene. Many
        conversations, events, and seminars happened in our space which were all
        aligned with the Third Space curatorial, practical, or theoretical
        framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        I could say my own experience within the collective was so different
        from what an outsider might have seen looking at all the activities
        happening in the space. It was where everything including concepts and
        theories, became more tangible: the conflict, fragility, and unity, all
        at the same time. Different ideologies, different practices, different
        backgrounds, different ways of doing, and different approaches even to
        the physical space. It became more and more clear to me that there were
        so many differences that those could easily create and ignite a
        conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
        My overall experience within the collective, particularly in the past,
        has been learning and at the same time unlearning certain things. The
        fact that from theory to practice there is a huge gap is what I
        concretely learned from Third space. Sometimes theory is too far from
        action. How we can put our theories into action, this is what I am
        interested in our collective work. It is not disappointing, it is
        actually amazing to be pragmatic.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you said, Martina, the ability to listen, and also failure in
        listening; whose voice is heard and whose is not, who speaks fluent
        English and who does not, through this dynamic one can learn a lot, and
        I did. The capacity of our collective has been fascinating, the
        possibility of getting to know everybody individually, and to establish
        friendships, without that I couldn’t continue. Getting to know each
        other takes time, and so does finding some sort of ground to work
        together. It is not easy and there are failures which makes it all
        harder. Despite all the difficulties, with trust and hard work we have
        made it possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The identity of Third Space has been extremely hybrid, at times one
        could feel it is not possible to put all these patches together and move
        forward. There existed so many differences, some people were good in
        working with theoretical frameworks and philosophizing and some were
        good in practicalities and making actual (physical) work in the space.
        At times, it felt the balance was lost: of course voices of the people
        who were more into theory would prevail over the ones who would run the
        space. So, the ones who would take care of practicalities to repair the
        space, clean, and host the artists, were reduced to “not important”
        enough to be heard particularly in the collective’s decision making
        processes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, we, together have done a massive work by hosting over
        three hundred events at Third Space, we got the “in between space” to
        come into reality. The trust we established amongst ourselves over time
        helped us to carry on and to improve our ways of working together. More
        importantly we have been there for the artists and other collaborators
        to incubate their ideas and projects in our space. This has been a
        collective work out of passion, a place of interest. We work voluntarily
        without wages and on top of that we pay the rent from our own pocket to
        support the artists whose practices are not part of the mainstream.
        Sometimes we receive a modest grant to pay the rent (partially) and buy
        equipment for everyone to use in the space.
    </p>
    <p>
        What does Third Space mean to me now, is our collective, us, and of
        course hosting others and their ideas in our space, the failures and
        mistakes. It is the process of making and learning from each other and
        together.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Ana: </b>Yeah, and you know, we are humans and it is impossible not
        to make mistakes. If we can just embrace failure, then we will always be
        strong.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Sepideh:</b> Yeah, but what I did not expect was that the situation
        would reach such a vulnerable point that collaboration and sometimes
        friendship seemed to become difficult to hold on. It has been learning
        for me on how to repair, to recover, and to accept that it can happen
        with differences in ideologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Ana:</b> It has also been a process of learning that sometimes
        collaboration is simply impossible. It is important to recognize how and
        when to work with others.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Sepideh: </b>Also to compromise, compromising in what we do, how we
        do, and why we do it, has been always present until today, and will be
        in future as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Elina:</b> It is interesting to look back at the time I joined as I
        really didn't know what I was coming into. I joined shortly after
        Martina, who invited me, and who was actually the only member I knew ⎼I
        had met Rosamaria a few times, but the rest I didn’t know at all. I
        still expected to be introduced into somehow defined working culture and
        order, but it soon became clear that I entered at an exceptionally
        chaotic moment, and just about everything was open. Most elemental
        questions on the collective(’s) practices were on the table to be
        renegotiated just there and then. The whole deal turned out to be
        something way more intimate than I had thought, and extremely engaging
        in ways beyond collegial collaboration. There was quite a bit of tension
        and anxiety there, not only in the aftermath of the recent upheavals but
        also with tackling new conflicts. In the discussions, the health of the
        community or group often overrode the curatorial agenda in urgency. We
        had intense discussions on what actually is a <i>collective</i> and what
        is a <i>working group,</i> how to differentiate the two, and which one
        would we be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right now I feel like within the collective something has really moved
        forward, there’s genuine befriending and healing in the atmosphere
        amongst us. Despite the partially very stressful journey, the experience
        has turned out extremely important. After all, the very group we are now
        never sat down as friends and colleagues who wanted to create something
        together and came up with Third Space ⎼what the collective is today is a
        result of a complicated chain of events. Like you have mentioned, we
        come from diverse places via different paths and approaches, both
        workwise and as individuals. Working together it has become evident: we
        are certainly dealing with two entangled projects, one being the shaping
        and sustaining of a safer space for good internal relationships that
        nourish collaboration, and the second being the substantial work of
        co-creating and co-curating, also together with other people, spaces,
        and organizers. Like said, our logic of operating is by principle
        non-hierarchical and non-institutional, it is also very elastic and
        organic, and this locks us in constant negotiations. In this sense the
        openness that I was surprised about in the beginning has indeed
        remained. We recognize the fragility and fluidity of the concepts that
        define our statement: it must be regularly revised.
    </p>
    <p>
        I guess that in the end, as you pointed out already, the engine that has
        kept Third Space running despite the struggles must really be the mutual
        will to learn from and with each other: approaching heterogeneity as a
        condition for growing. While honest communication, respect, flexibility,
        sensitivity, and sense of responsibility should be essential in any form
        of collaboration, these notions are very relevant indeed for our
        statement and objective as an artist-run space and cultural project that
        aims at fostering inclusivity and diversity. Third Space is never going
        to be ready and, as we state, its identity and thus its practice is
        <i> transcultural:</i> it too is many, and relative, and transmuting
        along with its members and makers. At the core, there is this idea of
        Third Space as an <i> on-going project,</i> both in theory and practice,
        as a collective and within the art scene.
