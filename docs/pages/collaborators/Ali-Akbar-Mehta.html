<b> Museum of Impossible Forms (m{if})</b> is a cultural centre located in Kontula,
East-Helsinki. For us the Museum is a space in flux – a contested space representing
a contact zone, a space of unlearning, formulating identity constructs, norm-critical
consciousness and critical thinking, already containing within it the potential for the
para museum, the counter museum, the anti museum. ‘Impossible Forms’ are those
that facilitate the process of transgressing the boundaries/borders between art,
politics, practice, theory, the artist and the spectator.
Museum of Impossible Forms was founded by an independent group of Helsinki
artists/ curators/ philosophers/ activists/ pedagogists in spring 2017 as an antiracist
and queer-feminist project, a heterogeneous space, and as an experimental and
migrant form of expression. The Museum of Impossible Forms opens up a broad
horizon though its political character, its accessibility and openness, its multilingual <i>
library</i>,an ongoing <i> archive</i>, and through its <i>workshops and events</i> .
