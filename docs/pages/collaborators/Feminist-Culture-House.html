    Feminist Culture House (FCH) is an intersectional feminist organisation based in Helsinki, Finland,
    working with and for underrepresented artists and arts workers. Its co-founders are Katie Lenanton,
    Neicia Marsh, Orlan Ohtonen, and Selina Väliheikki. They want to see an art field that is more
    representative of—and accountable to—its constituents, and that functions in ways that are safer, fairer,
    and more comfortable for all kinds of bodies, identities, and agencies. 
    The main goal of FCH is to function as a supportive structure for those who are practicing in the Finnish
    art field, but due to—for example—structural racism and cis-sexism, have to work harder to be
    recognised. FCH aims to create a caring and inclusive feminist working community that is based on
    sharing, togetherness, celebrating, and supporting one’s peers. 
    FCH operates with the kind support of Kone Foundation: 6-month kick start  funding in 2019, and
    organisational funding from 2020-21.
