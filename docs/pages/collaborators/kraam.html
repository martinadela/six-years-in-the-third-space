    Since November 2015 Kraam artist-run space has been located in a former toy factory Polymer. 
    Kraam has been hosting exhibitions, movie nights, "Coffee without borders" meetings-talks, 
    feminist handicraft workshops, poster workshops for demonstrations, concerts and a free shops. 
    Kraam is initiated and run by artists Killu Sukmit and Minna Hint. Currently we are searching 
    to find a new space, new possible space to take it to the streets.
