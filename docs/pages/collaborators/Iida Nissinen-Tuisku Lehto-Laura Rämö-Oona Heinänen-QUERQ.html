    Iida has an artistic crisis and a fetish for dictionaries, Laura is a mixed media artist and a multitasker wizard, 
Tuisku loves trash and makes films and Oona is uncovering her way to the Obvious. We make room for friendship that invites 
wild & delicate forms of being and everything in between. We share an interest in growing and an artistic curiosity to the 
overwhelming yet enchanting unknown. Iida, Laura, Oona & Tuisku are members of QUERQ Ry which focuses on creating safer and 
non-hierarchical urban culture. The association hosts a space called Nurja in Vallila, Helsinki. We aim to challenge the 
normative structures that limit the expressions of intimacy and ways of co-existing.
