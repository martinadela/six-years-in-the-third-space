    Marko Timlin is a German-Finnish sound artist, installation artist,
    performer and composer. His work focuses on the technical and philosophical
    development of large-scale kinetic sound & light sculptures, performances
    with self-made sound machines and multimedia theater plays. Marko Timlin
    began his artistic career in London at the beginning of the 1990s. His
    involvement with the alternative electronic music scene led him to former
    East Berlin, where, among other things, he founded the group tritop, one of
    Germany’s first live drum'n'bass groups. During this time he also developed
    new methods of combining acoustic instruments with samplers, synthesizers
    and computerized control systems. Nowadays he lives and works as a freelance
    artist in Söderkulla, close to Helsinki. These days he is fascinated by
    employing technology to transform natural phenomena into sound and light. In
    this way, he seeks to create new and inspiring links between nature, man and
    technology. Additionally, he strives to “humanize” the world of machines
    through the totally alienated and poetic use of technology and by
    transferring human imagination to it. He also loves to give workshops and
    seminars at universities and cultural institutions. Timlin's artworks are
    presented worldwide including at Sound & Sight Festival Montreal (CA) - Mal
    au Pixel Festival Paris (FR) - E:vent Gallery London (UK) - Neues Museum
    Nürnberg (DE) - Museum of Contemporary Art KIASMA Helsinki (FI) - White Box
    New York (USA) - Fylkingen Stockholm (SE) - Espoo Museum of Modern Art (FI)
    and Electronic Music Research & Creation Centre Nanchang (CN).
