<i> Rosa María Sánchez Hernández</i> better known as Rosamaría Bolom (Mexico/Finland).

that contribute to the cultural-artistic scene in Finland. From 2013 she has been involved at

        <i> Martina Miño Pérez</i> (Quito, Ecuador, 1990) is a visual artist, writer, cultural manager and
        cook who currently works between Helsinki, Quito and Berlin. Martina did her masters in
        Visual Culture, Curating and Contemporary Art at Aalto University of Arts, Design and
        Architecture in Finland and focused her thesis on The Sense of Taste and the Act of Eating
        as Metaphorical Tools. At the moment she creates edible installations that explore the various ways in which
        food functions as a symbolic device in contemporary art. Her research investigates domesticity as a 
        sphere of radical thought, and the body as a tool for sensitive interpretation. Martina has been part of 
        Third Space Collective since 2016.

        <i> Elina Nissinen​​ </i> is a visual artist working mainly by painting and ceramics. Currently pursuing an 
        MFA degree in the Academy of Fine Arts, Uniarts, her interests revolve around the idea of the 
        unknown/unknowable, an attempt to get lost, and rediscovering the wonder of fantasizing. She is also 
        curious, e.g., about the concepts of presence & absence, the point where image and object cling 
        onto each other, and the question of what distinguishes meaning from meaninglessness. Elina’s 
        collaborative projects explore (alternative) narratives, beliefs, collective anxieties, and coping 
        methods embedded in Western contemporary culture - these themes have an echo in her solo work, too.
        Elina joined the Third Space collective in November 2017.

        <i> Ana Gutieszca ​​ </i> (Mexico) is a visual and sound artist born in the dry lands of the northern Mexican plateau.
        Drawing is the core of her work. By addressing the question of the animal and its ambivalent presence through symbolic thinking, she embraces the otherness. With a background in visual arts and music, she sculpts the unfathomable boundaries of drawing through the creation of analog instruments, the sonification of graphite and its deconstruction into performance art.
        Her music is rough as the desert, combining hypnotic brain-melting noise from self-made analogs and blistering broken techno beats from drum machines.
        She is also known for being a founder member of Third Space, where she actively curates the Sound Room concert series.
