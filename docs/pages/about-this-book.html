Six years. A lot has started, a lot has ended, and a lot has changed.
</p>
<p>
Six years in the Third Space, is just the beginning. We hope.
</p>
<p>
Six years in the Third Space, learning better ways to host ideas, engage with people, and promote fairer cultural practices. 
</p>
<p>
How often do we position everything, through a “stable point of view”? People, knowledge, ways of doing, ways of being, have 
always been demanded by western thought to be clear and predictable in order to be valid and ultimately, controllable. 
It has become increasingly evident how the unpredictability of people’s <i> moving ways</i> and <i> moving needs</i> has triggered violent responses 
from structures of power. 
</p>
<p>
Third Space, as a cross-border artist collective and a long-term cultural project, has been for over <i> six years </i> a nest of inclusive 
practices working from diverse geopolitical views and backgrounds. For six years, we have been reflecting on the meaning of collective work: 
listening, learning, un-learning, and also accepting the complexities and challenges that come with the act of “working together”. Third Space 
as a collective in its ongoing transformation would not be what it is now without the work of all the people who have inhabited it and collaborated 
in its shaping. Since December 2013, we have organized over<i> three hundred and five events</i> and had a chance to collaborate and co-organize with over 
<i>six hundred and eight people,</i>  including artists, curators and art educators.    
</p>
<p>
The art scene  in Finland, similarly to an interplanetary space, is full of satellites of different shapes, dimensions and purposes, surrounding each other, 
 sometimes approaching, other times taking different routes, but always sharing the same intention of questioning and improving the conditions of art and culture 
 in society. As the art field becomes increasingly capitalized and art practices highly individualized, we have strived to promote collaborative practices over 
 competitive ones. This is why, for the sixth anniversary of Third Space, we launched a publication that specifically tackles conversations on how we share and 
 negotiate this space of collaboration.
</p>
<p>
<i> Six Years in the Third Space</i> is a publication that celebrates the act of collaboration as a constellation of exchange where there is not one fixed point of view or 
of action but a plural, open and horizontal space of cultural dialogue. The publication compiles the valuable work of artists and cultural actors from institutions and 
non-institutions who we have been working with through the years or we hope to work with in the future. Third Space´s role, most importantly, has been to facilitate <i> a space 
for encounters, a space for people, a space for dialogue</i> through art and its production while acknowledging disagreements, challenges and conflicts. 
Third Space has provided self-funded, free-of-charge space that welcomed multidisciplinary projects and open discussions on sociopolitical issues and contexts. 
The artists, collectives, curators, educators, and institutions featured in this virtual publication were invited to reflect on the various aspects of collaboration 
from the perspective of their own practice. Some of the themes proposed through these reflections were time / space , community, failure, lines / borders, theory / 
action, encounter / dis-encounter, and host / guest. 
</p>
 <p>
    Last but not least, during these six years our collective and its history has been shaped by the efforts of nineteen former members.  In this sixth year anniversary 
    we thank you all for contributing to this collective’s growth: Daniel Malpica (poet and graphic designer), Eva Karhu (photographer and sculptor), Ahmed Al-Nawas 
    (curator and artist), Christopher Wessels (filmmaker and hustler), Juan Duarte Regino (media artist and researcher), Selina Väliheikki (curator), Ali Akbar Mehta 
    (transmedia artist, curator and researcher), Steve Maher (visual and relational artist), Sébastien Piquemal (computer engineer and explorer of the artistic capabilities 
    of machines), Marianne Savallampi (curator), Raine Vasquez (artist and writer), Elham Rahmati (visual artist and curator), Ramina Habibollah (multidisciplinary artist and curator), 
    and Jaime Culebro (photographer).  

 </p>
 <p>
    We work, we hope and wait for the future to come… Third Space may become: a collective space, a hosting motel, an activism site, a kitchen, a social and political sphere or a 
    communal center inhabiting different forms, peoples and ideologies.
