                Six years. A lot has started, a lot has ended, and a lot has
                changed.

                Six years in (the) Third Space: learning better ways to host
                ideas, engage with people, and promote fairer cultural
                practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Six years in (the) Third Space is just the beginning, we hope.

        Similarly to an interplanetary space full of satellites of different
        dimensions and speeds, routes and missions, the art scene is a
        constellation of varying projects, operators, and spaces coexisting and
        rotating around each other: sometimes coming together and at other times
        traveling outward towards their own destinations ⎼still ultimately
        linked to one another by a common scope of purpose. In their own means,
        all aim at improving the conditions of and for art and culture in
        society. Simultaneously, and along with the sociocultural course at
        large, the global contemporary art field is becoming increasingly
        capitalized and art practices are highly individualized. Embraced
        especially by the western thought (ostensibly guarding individual
        freedom), knowledge, people, and other beings, objects, and ways of
        doing and being are assessed by their commercial value, efficiency,
        measurability, homogeneity, and normativity. That is: their
        controllability. In the violent responses to the recent international
        movements for human rights and equality, and in the midst of the global
        pandemic, it has yet again become evident that societal structures are
        largely built indeed to maintain systemic oppression.

        Based in Helsinki, Finland, Third Space strives to have an impact on the
        local situation by promoting collaborative practices over competitive
        ones. A cross-border artist collective and a long-term cultural project,
        Third Space has been for over six years now a nest for inclusive art
        practices. Our role, most importantly, has been to facilitate a space
        for encounters,
        <i>
            a space for people, a space for dialogue through art, and its
            production ⎼ while acknowledging the inevitable disagreements,
            challenges, and conflicts.</i
        >
        Third Space has provided self-funded, free-of-charge space that has
        welcomed multidisciplinary projects and open discussions on
        sociopolitical issues and contexts. Since December 2013, we have hosted
        305 events and had a chance to collaborate and co-organize with 608
        people including artists, curators, researchers, and art educators.
        Working through our diverse geopolitical views and backgrounds, we have
        been practicing collaboration and reflecting on its meanings: listening,
        sharing, (un)learning, and also accepting the complexities and
        challenges that come along with collective work. As a project in ongoing
        transformation, Third Space would not be what it is now without the work
        of everyone who has inhabited it and contributed to its shaping.

        For our sixth anniversary, we launch this virtual publication that
        specifically tackles the question of (and sets examples on) how to share
        and negotiate the space for collaboration.
        <i>"Six Years in the Third Space" </i> celebrates working and doing
        together as a plural, open and horizontal space for cultural dialogue: a
        practice of empathy and exchange. The publication compiles the valuable
        work of artists and cultural workers, institutions, and non-institutions
        who we have been working with through the years, or hope to work with in
        the future. The featured contributors were invited to reflect on the
        various aspects of collaboration from the perspective of their own
        practice. We also proposed the entries to consider conceptual lenses
        such as
        <i>
            time/space, community, failure, lines/borders, theory/action,
            encounter/dis-encounter, and host/guest.
        </i>

        Over these six years, the journey of Third Space has been shaped by the
        collective efforts of nineteen people including former members. For this
        anniversary we want to warmly thank you all for contributing to the
        growth of Third Space: <i> Daniel Malpica </i> (poet and graphic

        We will continue working for the now and towards the fluid future. Third
        Space may become many yet unimaginable things… a new type of collective
        space, an activism site, a kitchen, a social and political sphere or a
        communal center hosting people and beings; moving ways and moving needs,
        art, utopias, and ideologies, dreams and ideas.
